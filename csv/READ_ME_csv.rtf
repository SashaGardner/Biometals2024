\f0\fs24 \cf0 This folder contains .csv files with the excitation data extracted from Q-chem TD-DFT output files for the different calculated structures. All of the calculations were first optimized with B3LYP-D3(BJ)/cc-pVDZ then TD-DFT was run with CAM-B3LYP/aug_cc-pVDZ and have a sextet spin. Except for ex_state_30.csv which is a quartet spin, ex_state_40.csv which is a quartet spin calculated with TPSSh/aug-cc-pVDZ, and ex_state_61.csv which is a sextet spin calculated with TPSSh/aug-cc-pVDZ.\
